# Wonka üç¨ üè≠ ü•á

```
A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men.

Willy Wonka circa. 1971
```

Wonka is your golden ticket to Solana NFTs.

What it **does not** do:

- Serve as a floation device
- Cure the blues
- Take out the garbage
- Fly

What it **does** do:

- Create Metaplex CandyMachine v2s
- Create NFTs with the mintTo instruction
- Update NFTs
- Create fanout wallets
- Multi-send NFTs

How it does it:

- Typescript
- Yoga GraphQL

## Getting Started

Wonka is easy to setup and use or deploy to your own infrastructure.

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the folder
3. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
4. Edit `.env` with the sample below
5. Run it with `yarn dev`

`.env`

```
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET=
PORT=
SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY=
SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY=
APP_ENV=development
TMP_STORAGE_DIR=tmp
```

## Try it out.

Wonka is currently live and available for your use at https://wonka.holaplex.tools

## Amman Usage

to develop locally with amman run:

```
amman start .ammanrc.js
```

This starts up a fresh local validator with a local storage proxy.
to get an explorer for this local validator you can visit:
https://amman-explorer.metaplex.com/#/clusterStats?cluster=custom&customUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8899

From another terminal window run:

```
ts-node -r dotenv/config localnet/run.ts
```

add code to `setup.ts` to test whatever you are working on

## Create a Production Build

To create a production ready build use `yarn build`. Build files can be found in `.next`.

Detailed documentation can be found at https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#nextjs-build-api

## What can Wonka do for you?

# Create Metaplex CandyMachine v2s

Send the following mutation to create a CandyMachineV2

```
candyMachineUpload(
  callbackUrl: <URL to POST to when candymachine is complete>,
  collectionMint: <COLLECTION MINT for CANDY MACHINE>,
  config: <JSON config compatible with SUGAR CLI, see below>,
  env: <MAINNET or DEVNET>,
  filesZipUrl: <URI of zip file that contains assets>,
  keyPair: <FULL KEYPAIR>,
  rpc: <PASS IN AN RPC URL>,
  setCollectionMint: <BOOL, set to true if you are passing a collection>
)

Example JSON config
 {
  "price": 0.1,
  "number": $ITEMS,
  "symbol": "TEST",
  "sellerFeeBasisPoints": 500,
  "gatekeeper": null,
  "solTreasuryAccount": "$(solana address)",
  "splTokenAccount": null,
  "splToken": null,
  "goLiveDate": 1654999999, // seconds since unix epoch
  "endSettings": null,
  "whitelistMintSettings": null,
  "hiddenSettings": $HIDDEN_SETTINGS,
  "uploadMethod": "${STORAGE}",
  "ipfsInfuraProjectId": "${INFURA_ID}",
  "ipfsInfuraSecret": "${INFURA_SECRET}",
  "awsConfig": {
      "bucket": "${AWS_BUCKET}",
      "profile": "${AWS_PROFILE}",
      "directory": "${AWS_DIRECTORY}"
  },
  "nftStorageAuthToken": "${NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN}",
  "shdwStorageAccount": $SHDW,
  "retainAuthority": true,
  "isMutable": true,
  "creators": [
  {
    "address": "$(solana address)",
    "share": 100
  }
]
}
```

After you send this mutation, Wonka will begin provisioning your candy machine, this can take a while. When wonka is done, it will ping the callback url with
`{ candyMachineAddress }`

# Create NFTs with the mintTo instruction

Send the following mutation to mint a new NFT to a specific account

```
mintNft(
  mintToAddress: <ADDRESS OF NFT RECIPIENT>,
  nftMetadata: <JSON OF ONCHAIN NFT METADATA>,
  nftMetadataJSON: <JSON of OFFCHAIN METADATA>,
  keyPair: <FULL SOLANA KEYPAIR>
)
```

This will mint an NFT and upload the included JSON. Once its complete, the NFT is minted to the passed `mintToAddress`.

# Update NFTs

Updating NFTs is nearly as easy as creating them!

Send the following mutation for a given NFT to change its json or on-chain data.

```
  updateNft(
    nftMintId: <MINT HASH OF NFT>,
    updateAuthority: <FULL KEYPAIR of UPDATE AUTHORITY>,
    newUri: <NEW METADATA URI>,
    payer: <FULL KEYPAIR OF PAYER>,
    newMetadataJson: <NEW JSON METADATA>,
    )
```

NOTE: this call should provide EITHER `newUri` OR `newMetadataJson`

The response will include the new JSON uri of the uploaded metadataJson if `newMetadataJson` is passed.

# Create fanout wallets

Hydra is an metaplex protocol that supports distributing tokens to multiple wallets automatically.
This API lets you create fanout wallets and distribute funds to them without having to sign transactions in the browser.

```
createFanout(
  keyPair: <KEYPAIR Of FANOUT WALLET OWNER>,
  name: <NAME OF FANOUT WALLET>,
  splTokenAddresses: <Token mint addresses for which the fanout will create token accounts to distribute from, leave empty for a native SOL only fanout>
  members: LIST OF MEMBERS, e.g. [
    {
      publicKey: <PUBKEY OF MEMBER>,
      shares: <SHARE of total proceeds from each distribution, must add up to 100>
    }

  ]
)
```
